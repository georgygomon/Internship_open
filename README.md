Dear user,

In this git repository you can find the R-code used by Georgy during his Internship as well as the report of the Internship. To get a broader understanding of the Intership please read the Internship report included in this repository. The following .R files are present:

1. Dataset.R: This is the main function one works from. All other functions are called from here. You can set-up a dataset using list_group and the parameters to apply Lasso, Overlap Group Lasso, Sparse Overlap Group Lasso and Overlap LARS. Plots of the support and prediction given by these 4 methods are then generated.
2. Automatically_make_groups.R: Function that automatically makes groups of the form described in the Internship wrap-up. 
3. Overlap_LARS: Function where the overlap LARS method is implemented
4. Prediction_support: Function that given a dataset calculates the support and prediction of the 4 overlapping group methods.

If there are any questions please feel free to email g.gomon@umail.leidenuniv.nl.

Good luck! Georgy
